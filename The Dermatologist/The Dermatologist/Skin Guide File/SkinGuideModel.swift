var eczema = SkinGuideModel( diseaseName: "Eczema", overView: "Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a condition that causes dry, itchy and inflamed skin. It's common in young children but can occur at any age. Atopic dermatitis is long lasting (chronic) and tends to flare sometimes. It can be irritating but it's not contagious. People with atopic dermatitis are at risk of developing food allergies, hay fever and asthma. Moisturizing regularly and following other skin care habits can relieve itching and prevent new outbreaks (flares). Treatment may also include medicated ointments or creams.\n", diseaseImage: ["Atopic dermatitis behind the knees", "Atopic dermatitis behind the chest"], cause: "In some people, atopic dermatitis is related to a gene variation that affects the skin's ability to provide protection. With a weak barrier function, the skin is less able to retain moisture and protect against bacteria, irritants, allergens and environmental factors — such as tobacco smoke. In other people, atopic dermatitis is caused by too much of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus on the skin. This displaces helpful bacteria and disrupts the skin's barrier function. A weak skin barrier function might also trigger an immune system response that causes the inflamed skin and other symptoms. Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is one of several types of dermatitis. Other common types are contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff). Dermatitis isn't contagious.\n", symptoms: "Atopic dermatitis (eczema) symptoms can appear anywhere on the body and vary widely from person to person. They may include: \n - Dry, cracked skin. \n - Itchiness (pruritus) \n - Rash on swollen skin that varies in color depending on your skin color \n - Small, raised bumps, on brown or Black skin \n - Oozing and crusting. \n - Thickened skin. \n - Darkening of the skin around the eyes. \n - Raw, sensitive skin from scratching. \n Atopic dermatitis often begins before age 5 and may continue into the teen and adult years. For some people, it flares and then clears up for a time, even for several years.\n", prevention: "Developing a basic skin care routine may help prevent eczema flares. The following tips may help reduce the drying effects of bathing: \n - Moisturize your skin at least twice a day. Creams, ointments, shea butter and lotions seal in moisture. Choose a product or products that work well for you. Ideally, the best one for you will be safe, effective, affordable and unscented. \n Using petroleum jelly on your baby's skin may help prevent development of atopic dermatitis. \n - Take a daily bath or shower. Use warm, rather than hot, water and limit your bath or shower to about 10 minutes. \n - Use a gentle, nonsoap cleanser. Choose a cleanser that's free of dyes, alcohols and fragrance. For young children, you usually need only warm water to get them clean — no soap or bubble bath needed. Soap can be especially irritating to the skin of young children. For people of any age, deodorant soaps and antibacterial soaps can remove too much of the skin's natural oils and dry the skin. Don't scrub the skin with a washcloth or loofah. \n - Pat dry. After bathing, gently pat the skin with a soft towel. Apply moisturizer while your skin is still damp (within three minutes). \n The triggers for atopic dermatitis vary widely from person to person. Try to identify and avoid irritants that trigger your eczema. In general, avoid anything that causes an itch because scratching often triggers a flare. \n Common triggers for atopic dermatitis include: \n - Rough wool fabric \n - Dry skin \n - Skin infection \n - Heat and sweat \n - Stress \n - Cleaning products \n - Dust mites and pet dander \n - Mold \n - Pollen \n - Smoke from tobacco \n - Cold and dry air \n - Fragrances \n - Other irritating chemicals \n  Infants and children may have flares triggered by eating certain foods, such as eggs and cow's milk. Talk with your child's health care provider about identifying potential food allergies. \n Once you understand what triggers your eczema, talk with your health care provider about how to manage your symptoms and prevent flares.\n", treatment: "The main treatments for atopic eczema are: \n - Emollients (moisturisers) – used every day to stop the skin becoming dry. \n - Topical corticosteroids – creams and ointments used to reduce swelling and redness during flare-ups. \n Other treatments include: \n  - Topical pimecrolimus or tacrolimus for eczema in sensitive sites not responding to simpler treatment. \n - Antihistamines for severe itching. \n - Bandages or special body suits to allow the body to heal underneath. \n - More powerful treatments offered by a dermatologist (skin specialist)" )




var skinCancer = SkinGuideModel(diseaseName: "Skin Cancer", overView: "Skin cancer — the abnormal growth of skin cells — most often develops on skin exposed to the sun. But this common form of cancer can also occur on areas of your skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight. There are three major types of skin cancer — basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. You can reduce your risk of skin cancer by limiting or avoiding exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Checking your skin for suspicious changes can help detect skin cancer at its earliest stages. Early detection of skin cancer gives you the greatest chance for successful skin cancer treatment.\n", diseaseImage: ["Basal cell carcinoma on white skin", "melanoma"], cause: "Skin cancer occurs when errors (mutations) occur in the DNA of skin cells. The mutations cause the cells to grow out of control and form a mass of cancer cells. \n Ultraviolet light and other potential causes : \n Much of the damage to DNA in skin cells results from ultraviolet (UV) radiation found in sunlight and in the lights used in tanning beds. But sun exposure doesn't explain skin cancers that develop on skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight. This indicates that other factors may contribute to your risk of skin cancer, such as being exposed to toxic substances or having a condition that weakens your immune system.\n", symptoms: "Melanoma signs include: \n - A large brownish spot with darker speckles \n - A mole that changes in color, size or feel or that bleeds \n - A small lesion with an irregular border and portions that appear red, pink, white, blue or blue-black \n - A painful lesion that itches or burns \n - Dark lesions on your palms, soles, fingertips or toes, or on mucous membranes lining your mouth, nose, vagina or anus.\n", prevention: "Most skin cancers are preventable. To protect yourself, follow these skin cancer prevention tips: \n - Avoid the sun during the middle of the day. For many people in North America, the sun's rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even in winter or when the sky is cloudy. \n You absorb UV radiation year-round, and clouds offer little protection from damaging rays. Avoiding the sun at its strongest helps you avoid the sunburns and suntans that cause skin damage and increase your risk of developing skin cancer. Sun exposure accumulated over time also may cause skin cancer. \n Wear sunscreen year-round. Sunscreens don't filter out all harmful UV radiation, especially the radiation that can lead to melanoma. But they play a major role in an overall sun protection program. \n Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours — or more often if you're swimming or perspiring. Use a generous amount of sunscreen on all exposed skin, including your lips, the tips of your ears, and the backs of your hands and neck.\n - Wear protective clothing. Sunscreens don't provide complete protection from UV rays. So cover your skin with dark, tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs, and a broad-brimmed hat, which provides more protection than a baseball cap or visor does. \n Some companies also sell photoprotective clothing. A dermatologist can recommend an appropriate brand. \n Don't forget sunglasses. Look for those that block both types of UV radiation — UVA and UVB rays. \n - Avoid tanning beds. Lights used in tanning beds emit UV rays and can increase your risk of skin cancer. \n - Be aware of sun-sensitizing medications. Some common prescription and over-the-counter drugs, including antibiotics, can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. \n Ask your doctor or pharmacist about the side effects of any medications you take. If they increase your sensitivity to sunlight, take extra precautions to stay out of the sun in order to protect your skin. \n - Check your skin regularly and report changes to your doctor. Examine your skin often for new skin growths or changes in existing moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. \n With the help of mirrors, check your face, neck, ears and scalp. Examine your chest and trunk, and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands. Examine both the front and back of your legs, and your feet, including the soles and the spaces between your toes. Also check your genital area and between your buttocks.\n", treatment: "Your treatment options for skin cancer and the precancerous skin lesions known as actinic keratoses will vary, depending on the size, type, depth and location of the lesions. Small skin cancers limited to the surface of the skin may not require treatment beyond an initial skin biopsy that removes the entire growth. \n If additional treatment is needed, options may include: \n - Freezing. Your doctor may destroy actinic keratoses and some small, early skin cancers by freezing them with liquid nitrogen (cryosurgery). The dead tissue sloughs off when it thaws. \n - Excisional surgery. This type of treatment may be appropriate for any type of skin cancer. Your doctor cuts out (excises) the cancerous tissue and a surrounding margin of healthy skin. A wide excision — removing extra normal skin around the tumor — may be recommended in some cases. \n - Mohs surgery. This procedure is for larger, recurring or difficult-to-treat skin cancers, which may include both basal and squamous cell carcinomas. It's often used in areas where it's necessary to conserve as much skin as possible, such as on the nose. \n During Mohs surgery, your doctor removes the skin growth layer by layer, examining each layer under the microscope, until no abnormal cells remain. This procedure allows cancerous cells to be removed without taking an excessive amount of surrounding healthy skin. \n - Curettage and electrodesiccation or cryotherapy. After removing most of a growth, your doctor scrapes away layers of cancer cells using a device with a circular blade (curet). An electric needle destroys any remaining cancer cells. In a variation of this procedure, liquid nitrogen can be used to freeze the base and edges of the treated area. \n These simple, quick procedures may be used to treat basal cell cancers or thin squamous cell cancers. \n - Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered energy beams, such as X-rays, to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy may be an option when cancer can't be completely removed during surgery. \n - Chemotherapy. In chemotherapy, drugs are used to kill cancer cells. For cancers limited to the top layer of skin, creams or lotions containing anti-cancer agents may be applied directly to the skin. Systemic chemotherapy can be used to treat skin cancers that have spread to other parts of the body. \n - Photodynamic therapy. This treatment destroys skin cancer cells with a combination of laser light and drugs that makes cancer cells sensitive to light. \n - Biological therapy. Biological therapy uses your body's immune system to kill cancer cells.")



var acne = SkinGuideModel(diseaseName: "Acne", overView: "Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages. Effective acne treatments are available, but acne can be persistent. The pimples and bumps heal slowly, and when one begins to go away, others seem to crop up. Depending on its severity, acne can cause emotional distress and scar the skin. The earlier you start treatment, the lower your risk of such problems.\n", diseaseImage: ["Cystic acne", "Common acne"], cause: "Four main factors cause acne: \n - Excess oil (sebum) production \n - Hair follicles clogged by oil and dead skin cells \n - Inflammation \n Acne typically appears on your face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders because these areas of skin have the most oil (sebaceous) glands. Hair follicles are connected to oil glands. \n The follicle wall may bulge and produce a whitehead. Or the plug may be open to the surface and darken, causing a blackhead. A blackhead may look like dirt stuck in pores. But actually the pore is congested with bacteria and oil, which turns brown when it's exposed to the air. \n Pimples are raised red spots with a white center that develop when blocked hair follicles become inflamed or infected with bacteria. Blockages and inflammation deep inside hair follicles produce cystlike lumps beneath the surface of your skin. Other pores in your skin, which are the openings of the sweat glands, aren't usually involved in acne. \n Certain things may trigger or worsen acne: \n - Hormonal changes. Androgens are hormones that increase in boys and girls during puberty and cause the sebaceous glands to enlarge and make more sebum. Hormone changes during midlife, particularly in women, can lead to breakouts too. \n - Certain medications. Examples include drugs containing corticosteroids, testosterone or lithium. \n - Diet. Studies indicate that consuming certain foods — including carbohydrate-rich foods, such as bread, bagels and chips — may worsen acne. Further study is needed to examine whether people with acne would benefit from following specific dietary restrictions. \n - Stress. Stress doesn't cause acne, but if you have acne already, stress may make it worse.\n", symptoms: "Acne signs vary depending on the severity of your condition: \n - Whiteheads (closed plugged pores). \n - Blackheads (open plugged pores). \n - Small red, tender bumps (papules). \n - Pimples (pustules), which are papules with pus at their tips. \n - Large, solid, painful lumps under the skin (nodules). \n - Painful, pus-filled lumps under the skin (cystic lesions). \n Acne usually appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders.\n", prevention: "Preventing acne is difficult if not impossible during normal hormonal changes. But some things can help: \n - Wash your face daily with warm water and a mild facial cleanser. \n - Routinely use moisturizer. \n - You don’t have to stop using makeup, but try to use “non-comedogenic” products and remove makeup at the end of each day.\n - Keep your hands away from your face.\n", treatment: "The most common topical prescription medications for acne are: \n - Retinoids and retinoid-like drugs. Drugs that contain retinoic acids or tretinoin are often useful for moderate acne. These come as creams, gels and lotions. Examples include tretinoin (Avita, Retin-A, others), adapalene (Differin) and tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage, others). You apply this medication in the evening, beginning with three times a week, then daily as your skin becomes used to it. It prevents plugging of hair follicles. Do not apply tretinoin at the same time as benzoyl peroxide. \n - Topical retinoids increase your skin's sun sensitivity. They can also cause dry skin and redness, especially in people with brown or Black skin. Adapalene may be tolerated best. \n - Antibiotics. These work by killing excess skin bacteria and reducing redness and inflammation. For the first few months of treatment, you may use both a retinoid and an antibiotic, with the antibiotic applied in the morning and the retinoid in the evening. The antibiotics are often combined with benzoyl peroxide to reduce the likelihood of developing antibiotic resistance. Examples include clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzaclin, Duac, others) and erythromycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzamycin). Topical antibiotics alone aren't recommended. \n - Azelaic acid and salicylic acid. Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring acid produced by a yeast. It has antibacterial properties. A 20% azelaic acid cream or gel seems to be as effective as many conventional acne treatments when used twice a day. Prescription azelaic acid (Azelex, Finacea) is an option during pregnancy and while breast-feeding. It can also be used to manage discoloration that occurs with some types of acne. Side effects include skin redness and minor skin irritation. \n - Salicylic acid may help prevent plugged hair follicles and is available as both wash-off and leave-on products. Studies showing its effectiveness are limited. Side effects include skin discoloration and minor skin irritation. \n - Dapsone. Dapsone (Aczone) 5% gel twice daily is recommended for inflammatory acne, especially in women with acne. Side effects include redness and dryness. \n Evidence is not strong in support of using zinc, sulfur, nicotinamide, resorcinol, sulfacetamide sodium or aluminum chloride in topical treatments for acne.")
